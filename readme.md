# TACHYONIC

Functional css custom properties for humans. An extension of Tachyons for use in Shadow DOM.

Quickly build and design new UI with custom properties.

## Principles

* Everything [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io) promises
* Plus compatibility with Shadow DOM

## Features

* Everything Tachyons offers
* Multiple debugging utilities to reduce layout struggles
* Single-purpose custom properties structure
* Lightweight (~7kB)
* Usable within Shadow DOM
* Built with Sass/Webpack

### Local Setup

Clone the repo from github and install dependencies through npm.

```
git clone https://github.com/splitinfinities/tachyonic.git
cd tachyons
npm install
```

#### Dev

If you want to just use everything in tachyons/src as a jumping off point and
edit all the code yourself, you can compile all of your wonderful changes by
running

```npm start```

This will output both minified and unminified versions of the css to the css directory and watch the src directory for changes.
It's aliased to the command:

```npm run watch```

If you'd like to just build the css once without watching the src directory run

```npm run build```
